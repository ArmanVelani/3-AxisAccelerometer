# How it reached upto breadboard milestone  

* I started with figuring out the basing ground and the vcc input pins on the raspberry pi and on the sensor. It was very easy as the sensor had all te pins labelled.
also the pins chart for raspberry pi was avaliable with the ultimate kit bought from canait
* Then a fritzing diagram was created showing the connections.
* After that the ciruit was tested on a stimulator.
* connected my sensor to the raspberry pi 3.
* rechecking the connections the raspberry pi was then connected to a display usin vga cable. Also keyboard and mouse were attached to the pi.
* Then the raspberry pi was turned on.
* on the terminal type "i2cdetect -y 1" ( without "") and checked if the sensor was connected properly to the pi.
