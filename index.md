### November 6th, 2018 (Week 10)

Today is the PCB soldered milestone, according to my [project schedule](https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/documentation/Week3RubricforProjectSchedule.xml) I am on track. since i started designing my PCB on 12 october2018 and have completed the designing, printing and soldering the board. i will finish with all the testing of my PCb upto 15 november 2018 as per my schedule.Something i found very useful was the datasheet for my sensor MMA8451. Regarding my financial status, my [budget](https://github.com/six0four/MicroRover/raw/master/PartsFor20MicroRoversRev02.xlsx) included headers but not the tackable ones, so i had to get it from the prototype lab. This wont add any direct expense on the budget as it is included in tuition cost for my course. Still in order to buy it i will provide the [link](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/stackable-header-for-raspberry-pi/). I took guidance and help from my professor Mr. Kristain Medri for creating the first Gerber files and then later modified it and sent for production. My new fritzing looks like this ![Image of PCB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/SSHrev05.jpg)
Also i have the image of my complete soldered and ready PCB ![here.]
