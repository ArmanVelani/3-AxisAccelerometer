### November 27th, 2018 (Week 13)

Today was my [presentation](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/raw/master/pptHArdware.pptx) Due. It went well as i covered all the topics required. Unfortunately after the presentation i dropped my stackable case and broke it. my sensors and raspberry pi were safe but the glass case shattered into pieces. Luckily i can print a new one from the corelDraw file i uploaded.
Also i Recently updated my github page so i would recommend to go through it from bottom(start)

### November 20th, 2018 (Week 12)

Here we were suppose to create casing for our Sensor and raspberry pi. I thought of creating a stackable case. On the first storey there will be raspberry pi, on second the sensor, and later you can keep stacking based on your requirement.

Here is image for the corelDraw cdr file that you can use for Laser cutting the case. Click image for downloading the cdr file.

Here is the image for the actual case that was printed and used. Click image for more Images.

I have also collabrated with Gursehaj Harika to made an extended case to fit in all sensors.

### November 13th, 2018 (Week 11)
I collabrated with [Gursehaj](https://gursehajharika.github.io/barometricsensor/) as my raspberry pi was correpted due to some technicial issues. we stacked our sensor together and tested it out. My Python code when run using 'Sudo Python3 Filename.py' it shows error but when using the command 'sudo Python2 Filename.py'and then again using 'sudo Python3 Filename.py' it works. I have not been able to figure it out yet. but it shows all the readings.

![Sensors Stacked and working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48862531-a260dd80-ed94-11e8-9e08-a28f0783966a.jpeg)

Here is my Python code that was used in order to read data from the Sensor. Click the image to get the link.

I am also uploading a video for it. You will have to [download](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/raw/master/WhatsApp%20Video%202018-11-13%20at%2010.57.24%20PM.mp4) it in order to view it.

My [Progress report](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/progressreport.md) is updated.

According to my [budget](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/Budget.xlsx) Nothing has changed so far other that the Stackable headers I talked before about.

### November 06th, 2018 (Week 10)

Today is the PCB soldered milestone, according to my [project schedule](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/Schedule.mpp). I am on track since i started designing my PCB on 12 october2018 and have completed the designing, printing and soldering the board. I will finish with all the testing of my PCB upto 15 november 2018 as per my schedule. Something i found very useful was the [datasheet](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/MMA8451Q-1.pdf) for my sensor [MMA8451](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00SK8LS4Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Regarding my financial status, [my budget](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/Budget.xlsx) included headers but not the stackable ones, so i had to get it from the prototype lab. This won't add any direct expense on the budget as the cost is included in tuition fees for my course. Still in order to buy it i will provide the [link](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/stackable-header-for-raspberry-pi/). I took guidance and help from my professor Mr. Kristain Medri for creating the first [Gerber](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/MMA8451.fzz) files and then later it was sent for production. My new fritzing looks like ![fritzing image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48366901-30deac00-e67d-11e8-860c-0fb92a65a9b9.jpeg)
Also i have the image of my complete soldered and ready PCB ![PCB image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48441706-3a8a1180-e75a-11e8-9a3f-52c6deba1b4c.jpeg)
i also wanted to attach some additional link for my [Pseudocode and UMl diagram](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/pseudocode_assingment.md), [Progress Report](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/progressreport.md).

### October 30th, 2018 (Week 09)

I have already Completed my PCB design Using the [Fritzing](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/MMA8451.fzz). My [Gerber](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/MMA8451_Gerber.zip) Files were sent for production and this is how my [PCB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48862001-01bdee00-ed93-11e8-898b-70c879b291d1.jpeg)
 looks like. I have attaced the headers for my sensor on the PCB. It looks same like how it was Expected.

### October 23th, 2018 (Week 08)

Today I showed up my breadboard that I completed in week 06 and later started working on my PCB design. The challenge here was to design a PCB that will be small enough to fit in the case that we are suppose to design in future. Also, the design has to be stackabe for future modifications. I was still working on the Gerber file that will be sent for production. 

### October 16th, 2018 (Week 07)

This week I was working with students from previous semester (Students were assingned by Mr. Kristain Medri.) for the [Pseudo code](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/pseudocode_assingment.md) and [UML diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48367169-deea5600-e67d-11e8-9f60-53604ff9a58f.png). I was assingned the task to check the work for other two students (Qureshi Shawn, Ramachandran Sajivaan) I was working with and create a UML diagram for it. The first student never showed up so I had to distribute the work with Sajivaan.


### October 09th, 2018 (Week 06)

I tested out my sensor By making the necessary connections and using the command 'Sudo I2C detect' on the terminal. I found this [link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mma8451-accelerometer-breakout/assembly) very helpful for soldering the headers and making connection.
here is the connection ofor my sensor on Breadboard.
![sensor connection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48366908-35a36000-e67d-11e8-9476-107ec0f8258f.jpeg)

### September 25th, 2018 (Week 04)

Today the Budget was due. My [budget](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/Budget.xlsx) includes most of the parts that I will need in order to complete the whole hardware of the Project.

### September 18th, 2018 (Week 03)

Today the project [Schedule](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/Schedule.mppwas) due. My schedule basically includes all the dates i need in order to finish my Project on time. Also I told Mr. Medri about the group I would prefer in future. I selected [Gursehaj](https://github.com/GursehajHarika) and [Shubham](https://github.com/Shubhamsharma1101) as i am already in a group with them for my software class. Gursehaj is currently working on a Barometric Pressure Sensor ([MS5611](https://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_436671_1.jpg)) whereas Shubham is working on Temperature Sensor ([TMP102](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0915/1182/products/13314-03a.jpg?v=1486427078)). In future we will connect all the sensors in order to use it as an extended attachment for Drones. It might be Published by our company we named as SAG Droning. (Shubham, Arman, Gursehaj Droning)

Hopes up! Seeking for the best...

### September 11th, 2018 (Week 02)

Today I picked a sensor topic to work on. I selected a triple Axis Acceleerometer([MMA8451](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/018/474/medium800/sensors_pinouts.jpg?1406662993)). This sensor is used in order to determine the x, y and z axis of a device it is attached on. I also submitted a proper proposal to my instruction Mr. Kristain Medri.

### September 04th, 2018 (Week 01)

Here I tested and Blinked an led on my Raspberry Pi 3. Althought it was not done on time due to personal Reason, I did not blog about it. The process I followed and other details are [here](https://six0four.github.io/ceng317/wk01.html).
