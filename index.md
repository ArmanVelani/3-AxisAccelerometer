### November 6th, 2018 (Week 10)

Today is the PCB soldered milestone, according to my [project schedule](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/Schedule.mpp). I am on track since i started designing my PCB on 12 october2018 and have completed the designing, printing and soldering the board. I will finish with all the testing of my PCB upto 15 november 2018 as per my schedule. Something i found very useful was the [datasheet](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/MMA8451Q-1.pdf) for my sensor [MMA8451](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00SK8LS4Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Regarding my financial status, my budget(will be uploaded soon) included headers but not the stackable ones, so i had to get it from the prototype lab. This won't add any direct expense on the budget as the cost is included in tuition fees for my course. Still in order to buy it i will provide the [link](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/stackable-header-for-raspberry-pi/). I took guidance and help from my professor Mr. Kristain Medri for creating the first [Gerber](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/MMA8451.fzz) files and then later it was sent for production. My new fritzing looks like ![fritzing image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48366901-30deac00-e67d-11e8-860c-0fb92a65a9b9.jpeg)
Also i have the image of my complete soldered and ready PCB ![PCB image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188450/48441706-3a8a1180-e75a-11e8-9a3f-52c6deba1b4c.jpeg)
i also wanted to attach some additional link for my [Pseudocode and UMl diagram](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/pseudocode_assingment.md), [Progress Report](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/progressreport.md).
